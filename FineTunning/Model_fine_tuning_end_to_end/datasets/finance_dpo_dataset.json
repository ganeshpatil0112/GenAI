    "input": "",
    "chosen": "RBI repo rate is the rate at which banks borrow from RBI. When repo rate increases, banks' borrowing costs rise, leading to increased lending rates (MCLR/RLLR). For existing home loans on floating rates, your EMI or tenure increases. For example, if repo rate increases by 0.50%, your loan rate may increase by 0.40-0.50%, adding thousands to your annual outgo. Conversely, repo rate cuts reduce EMIs. Fixed-rate loans remain unaffected. Most home loans in India are floating rate linked to MCLR/RLLR.",

Strategy: Identify equity funds/stocks in loss, sell before March 31, book loss, offset against LTCG/STCG, rebuy after 1 day (avoid wash sale). Example: Gain of Rs. 2L in Fund A (taxable), Loss of Rs. 50K in Fund B → Sell Fund B → Net gain Rs. 1.5L → Tax saved on Rs. 50K. STCG loss can offset STCG/LTCG, LTCG loss can offset only LTCG. Losses can be carried forward for 8 years if shown in ITR. Best done in January-February (plan properly). Avoid: Selling fundamentally good funds just for tax saving. Use in falling markets when holding losers.",

    "prompt": "How does auto-debit mandate for SIP work?",
    "input": "",
    "chosen": "SIP auto-debit setup: Register mandate (one-time) for auto-deduction from bank account. Types: 1) E-mandate (electronic) - instant, up to Rs. 15L, setup online via net banking/debit card, NPCI approved, 2) Physical mandate - signed form, any amount, 7-10 days processing. Post-registration: Auto-debit on SIP date, sufficient balance required (else SIP skips that month, no penalty but investment missed), 2-3 consecutive failures may cancel SIP, modify/cancel anytime online. Benefits: Disciplined investing, no manual intervention, hassle-free. Common issues: Insufficient balance, bank restrictions, expired debit card. Ensure adequate balance 1 day before SIP date. One mandate can handle multiple SIPs from same bank account.",
    "rejected": "Auto-debit for SIP is not safe. Banks can deduct any amount anytime. You have no control over your account. Always do manual payment for each SIP installment for security."

    "prompt": "What is the benefit of investing in index funds vs actively managed funds?",
    "input": "",
    "chosen": "Index Funds: Track index (Nifty50/Sensex), passive management, low expense ratio (0.1-0.5%), returns match index (10-12% historical), no fund manager risk, predictable performance. Actively Managed: Fund manager selects stocks, tries to beat index, high expense ratio (1-2.5%), potential for outperformance (12-15%+ for good funds), manager risk exists, 60-70% fail to beat index consistently. Choose index if: Long-term investor (>15 years), want low cost, don't want to research funds, prefer simplicity. Choose active if: Can identify consistently outperforming funds, accept higher costs, shorter horizon (5-10 years). Hybrid approach: 60% index + 40% active. For Nifty exposure, index funds clearly better (lower cost, same returns).",
    "rejected": "Index funds are for lazy investors. Actively managed funds always give higher returns. There's no point in investing in index funds as they just give average returns. Active funds are always superior in every way."

    "input": "",
    "chosen": "Retirement planning steps: 1) Current age: 35, Retirement age: 60 (25 years), Life expectancy: 85 (25 years post-retirement), 2) Current monthly expenses: Rs. 50K, Future at 60 (6% inflation): Rs. 2.15L/month, Annual: Rs. 25.8L, 3) Corpus needed (assuming 6% return post-retirement): Rs. 4.3 crore, 4) Monthly SIP needed (assuming 12% return): Rs. 42,000/month. Consider: EPF accumulation, inflation, medical costs (increase buffer by 30%), lifestyle changes. Asset allocation: Pre-retirement-70% equity, 30% debt; Post-retirement-30% equity, 70% debt. Income sources: EPF, NPS, rental income, pension. Use retirement calculators, review annually, increase SIP with salary hikes (step-up SIP). Start early-time is biggest advantage.",
    "rejected": "Just invest Rs. 10,000 per month in mutual funds and you'll have enough for retirement. No need for detailed planning or calculations. Retirement planning is very simple and doesn't require much saving."

    "prompt": "What is credit card churning and is it recommended?",
    "input": "",
    "chosen": "Credit card churning: Applying for multiple cards to earn sign-up bonuses, rewards, then canceling and repeating. Pros: High rewards (10K-50K points), welcome benefits, fee waivers first year. Cons: Multiple hard inquiries reduce CIBIL score (10-15 points each), too many cards reduce future credit limit, annual fees if not canceled on time, managing multiple cards is hassle, banks may blacklist for aggressive churning. Recommendation: Not advisable in India. CIBIL score is critical for home/car loans. Better approach: Keep 2-3 good cards long-term (improves credit age), optimize usage for maximum rewards, negotiate fee waiver/upgrades with existing banks. Limited churning acceptable (1 card per year) if you have strong credit profile (>800 score).",
    "rejected": "Credit card churning is the best strategy to earn unlimited rewards. Apply for 10-15 credit cards every year to get maximum benefits. It doesn't affect your credit score at all and banks encourage this practice."

    "input": "",
    "chosen": "Step-up SIP: Systematic plan where SIP amount increases periodically (annually/semi-annually) by fixed amount (Rs. 500, Rs. 1000) or percentage (10%, 15%). Example: Start Rs. 5,000/month with 10% annual step-up → Year 1: Rs. 5K, Year 2: Rs. 5.5K, Year 3: Rs. 6.05K. Benefits: 1) Aligns with salary increments, 2) Accelerated wealth creation (30-40% higher corpus), 3) Beats inflation, 4) Disciplined savings increase. Calculation example: Rs. 10K SIP for 20 years at 12% = Rs. 1 crore vs Rs. 10K step-up SIP (10% annual increase) = Rs. 1.5 crore (50% more). Recommendation: Start with affordable amount, set 10-15% annual step-up, review periodically. Most AMCs allow step-up in SIP registration form or modify later.",

    "input": "",
    "chosen": "Dividend Option: Fund pays dividend periodically, NAV reduces by dividend amount, dividend is taxable at slab rate (TDS 10% if >Rs. 5K), suitable for regular income needs, lower long-term wealth. Growth Option: No dividend, returns reinvested, NAV grows continuously, tax only on redemption (LTCG 12.5% after 1 year), better compounding, higher long-term wealth. Example: Rs. 1L invested for 10 years at 12%: Growth option = Rs. 3.1L (tax on redemption), Dividend option = Rs. 2.8L (after annual dividend tax). Recommendation: Growth option for wealth creation and tax efficiency. Dividend option only if you need regular cash flow for expenses. Can do SWP (Systematic Withdrawal) from growth option for tax-efficient income.",
    "rejected": "Dividend option is always better because you get regular income in hand. Growth option is just on paper gains which are not real. Always choose dividend option for all mutual funds."

Tools: Valueresearchonline, Morningstar. Review portfolio quarterly, replace underperformers (bottom quartile for 3 years). Don't chase recent outperformers.",

Critical Illness Insurance: Lump-sum payout on diagnosis of specified illnesses (cancer, heart attack, stroke, kidney failure-24-40 conditions), regardless of actual treatment cost, one-time benefit, use money for treatment/lifestyle/recovery, separate from health insurance. Recommendation: Both needed. Health insurance for medical bills (Rs. 10L+), critical illness as income replacement during recovery (Rs. 25-50L). Critical illness claim doesn't affect health insurance. Ideal coverage: Base health insurance + top-up + critical illness + term insurance.",

Suitable for: Parking surplus for 3-12 months, alternative to liquid funds for tax efficiency, conservative investors, volatile markets (more arbitrage opportunities).
